//! Low-level backends for data storage.
//!
//! This module provides low-level data storage backends called data stores. A data store provides
//! only the most basic storage operations, and doesn't have to worry about providing features like
//! encryption, compression, deduplication, integrity checking, locking, or atomic transactions.
//! Those features are implemented at a higher level. Data stores are meant to be easy to implement
//! so that providing support for new storage backends is relatively painless.
//!
//! All data stores implement the `DataStore` trait.
//!
//! Many of the data stores in this module are gated behind cargo features. See the crate-level
//! documentation for more details.
